**Important Note**

ALSXT is not automatically synced with the main ALS-Refactored repository, but is instead maintained through [this fork](https://github.com/Voidware-Prohibited/ALS-Refactored). If you find changes in ALS-Refactored have broken ALSXT you may use this fork to maintain more stability in your projects.

# Installation

- Begin with an empty C++ Project
- Install and setup Enhanced Input Plugin
- Install and setup MetaSound Plugin
- Install the latest version of ALS-Refactored via https://github.com/Sixze/ALS-Refactored#quick-start
- Clone/download ALSXT into your projects Plugin folder (You should have both ALS-Refactored and ALSXT side by side)
- Build your Solution in Visual Studio again
- Once compilation is successful you can now begin using ALSXT in your project

# Settings

Most Settings are set in the ALSXT Character Settings Data Assets in the Character Blueprint. This is where you would customize animations, sounds, parameters and toggle features.

# Contributions

If you wish to contribute, please ensure you are in sync with both ALSXT and ALS-Refactored. While I try to stay in sync with ALS-Refactored, at times it may be temporarily out of sync and features may break or need refactoring.
